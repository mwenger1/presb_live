	<div class="about">
	<p>Preby Hangouts is a video chat room where patients, caregivers and health administrators can connect about common experiences, meet new people and share new health programs and initiatives. </p>
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>When you enter, you will be prompted to identify your interests. Then, you can broswe Hangouts based on topic, or schedule a Hangout of your own. If you find Hangouts you like, you can add it to your calendar and join when the time comes.</p>
	<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
	<p>The hospital is a large place, and many people aren't mobile during their stay. Health data has proven that people-to-people interaction can increase happiness during a hospital visit, and in turn, shorten the length of patient stays. We want you to feel like a comfortable, connected community and to meet new people going through similar experiences.
